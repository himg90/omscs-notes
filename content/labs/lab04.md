# Project 5 Paxos

## Understanding Paxos

The main reference for this lab is [Paxos Made Moderately Complex](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs7412/2011sp/paxos.pdf). The paper is long but it's very readable. But before reading the paper, I would recommend understanding paxos and multi-paxos. For Paxos, I would recommend watching [L9: Paxos Simplified](https://youtu.be/SRsK-ZXTeZ0?t=719) by Chris Colohan from time 11:58. Next, for multi-panos, watch [Paxos lecture (Raft user study)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsBg0AO6o) by Diego Ongaro. After watching these two videos, proceed to read the paper.
