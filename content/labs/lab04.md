# Project 5 Paxos

## Understanding Paxos

The main reference provided for this lab is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs7412/2011sp/paxos.pdf">Paxos Made Moderately Complex</a>. The paper is long but it's readable. An alternative to the paper is <a target="_blank" href="https://paxos.systems/how/" >this article</a> by the same authors. The article, however, only covers upto section 3 of the paper. 

Before reading the paper, I would recommend understanding paxos and multi-paxos. For Paxos, I would recommend watching <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/SRsK-ZXTeZ0?t=719">L9: Paxos Simplified</a> by Chris Colohan. The explaination for Paxos starts from time 11:58. Next, for multi-panos, watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsBg0AO6o"> Paxos lecture (Raft user study) </a> by Diego Ongaro. In fact, you can watch this video for both Paxos and Multi-Paxos.
