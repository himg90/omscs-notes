1 Introduction What is global state of a distributed system?
It is the union of the states of the individual processes.
Why do we study construction of global state?
A large class of problems in distributed computing can be cast as executing some action when the state of the system satisfies a particular condition.</description></item><item><title>W07 - Amazon Aurora</title><link>https://www.digestnotes.com/readings/07_amazon_aurora/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.digestnotes.com/readings/07_amazon_aurora/</guid><description>Amazon Aurora: On Avoiding Distributed Consensus for I/Os, Commits, and Membership Changes - Alexandre Verbitski, Anurag Gupta, Debanjan Saha, James Corey, Kamal Gupta Murali Brahmadesam, Raman Mittal, Sailesh Krishnamurthy, Sandor Maurice Tengiz Kharatishvilli, Xiaofeng Bao

Q: How does external consistency relate to linearizability and serializability?
A: External consistency seems to be equivalent to linearizability, but applied to entire transactions rather than individual reads and writes. External consistency also seems equivalent to strict serializability, which is serializability with the added constraint that the equivalent serial order must obey real time order.</description></item></channel></rss>
