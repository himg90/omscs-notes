This paper is an easy read and not very long. Moreover, first few pages just repeat the same thing over and over. So, you can read through it in a couple of hours.
Big Ideas
Global/physical clocks donâ€™t work for distributed processes. So, we use a system of logical clocks where each process has its own clock.</description></item><item><title>W03 - Consistent Global States</title><link>https://www.digestnotes.com/readings/w03_consistent_global_states/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.digestnotes.com/readings/w03_consistent_global_states/</guid><description>Consistent Global States of Distributed Systems Fundamental Concepts and Mechanisms Link to Paper
1 Introduction What is global state of a distributed system?
It is the union of the states of the individual processes.
Why do we study construction of global state?
A large class of problems in distributed computing can be cast as executing some action when the state of the system satisfies a particular condition.</description></item><item><title>W07 - Spanner</title><link>https://www.digestnotes.com/readings/w07spanner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.digestnotes.com/readings/w07spanner/</guid><description>Spanner FAQ Source: MIT 6.824 - Distributed Systems &amp;gt; Spanner FAQs
Q: What is time? A: 13:00:00.000 April 7th 2020 UTC is a time. Time advances at a steady rate of one second per second. Q: What is a clock? A: A clock is an oscillator driving a counter. The oscillator should tick at a steady known rate (e.g. one tick per second). The counter must initially be synchronized to a source of the correct time; after that, the oscillator's ticks cause the counter to advance the time.</description></item></channel></rss>
